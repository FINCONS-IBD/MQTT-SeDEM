<H1>MQTT SeDEM Browser<br></H1>

<H2>A Java Web Application to demostrate the use of MQTT SeDEM Library<br></H2>

</CENTER>
The MQTT SeDEM Browser is a web application that, subscribed to the TagITSmart! Stream Processing event topic, uses the SeDEM Libraries (see: https://github.com/FINCONS-IBD/MQTT-SeDEM)and displays each received event both in its encrypted and decrypted forms.
To this end the SeDEM Browser will use a CP-ABE key in line with the access policy provided by the data publisher.

<H3>Initial Configuration</H3>

The configuration of the SeDEM Browser is provided by the editing of the web.xml file located in the WEB-INF folder. In particular: 
<ul>
<li><i>thing_id</i> - the EVRYTHNG thing identifier associated to the MQTT topic to subscribe to for the consumption of this thing</li>
<li><i>mqtt_conf_dec_subscriber</i> - the full path where the first subscriber configuration file is located. N.B. in this file it is important to set the CPABE_AES_ENCRYPTION to false disabling the decryption process. For the other settings please refer to the SeDEM Library documentation.</li>
<li><i>mqtt_conf_enc_subscriber</i> - the full path where the second subscriber configuration file is located. N.B. in this file it is important to set the CPABE_AES_ENCRYPTION to true enabling the decryption process. For the other settings please refer to the SeDEM Library documentation.</li>
<li><i>log4j.properties</i> - the full path where the Logger configuration file is located. For more details please refer to the SeDEM Library documentation.</li>
<li><i>SocketServerEncrypt</i> - the endpoint URL of the Encrypted Web Socket (e.g. ws://localhost:8080/SEDEM_Browser_MQTT/encryptedMessage) where the encrypted messages will be displayed</li>
<li><i>SocketServerDecypted</i> - the endpoint URL of the Decrypted Web Socket where the decrypted messages will be displayed</li>
</ul>

For more details about the configuration procedure of the SeDEM Library please refer to the SeDEM Library documentation (see: https://github.com/FINCONS-IBD/MQTT-SeDEM)
