# Device-Entity
This library provides support to any client device that needs to implement CPABE encryption and decryption and needs to interact with the ABE-Proxy component. 

The library provides the high level algorithms and entities to perform AES or CPABE encryption and decryption operations and the methods to interact with the ABE-Proxy through the http/https protocol.

## Installation guide
The library is provided as mavenized project, then it is easy to build the library jar with dependencies using the *pom.xml* file as usual in a maven project.

## Software dependencies
 To use this software, you will need to have the *CPABE library* (see [here](https://github.com/FINCONS-IBD/MQTT-SeDEM/tree/master/CPABE)) referenced in the *pom.xml* file.
